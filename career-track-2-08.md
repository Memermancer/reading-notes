### Composition vs Inheritance
Facebook developers recommend using composition rather than inheritance to pass code between components in react. When components don't know their children ahead of time you can pass a special 'children' prop.
Specialization comes from components that are special cases of a more general component. this can be achieved with the specific component rendering the generic one with special props. Inheritance is less flexible.
