**Project ideas
1) My first and best project idea is a quiz show game, which could utilize the jService API to populate questions and answers. I am also interested in the idea of generating questions based off of templates using a 'normal' API like No key No Shade. 

2) The second would be a total experiment into the unknown, trying to get voice commands to work. The app itself would be a to do list, with the party piece being the voice recognition API.

3) An API that I really like is the Bored API. Perhaps a calendar that leverages famous quotes from another API and suggested activities from Bored would be a cool project. Using multiple APIs would be a great way to flex.

4) There is also a DnD 5th Edition API that would be very fun to use and very much in line with what I want to pursue for my career. Making an app would probably end up as a list of favorite spells and monsters with our current skills.

5) "This day in History" app using the New York Times api... maybe this could be part of the mega calendar app?

6) Art museum previewer. Both Rijksmuseum and the Harvard Art Museums APIs look really cool, and I have a passion for art that would be fun to share.
