**MDN
I didn't know that `` were called grave accents. I used this technique before. Newline characters being automatic in template literals is new though. 

**Google Developer
Template Strings add a ton of functionality and ease of use that normal string do not have. The biggest is string substitution. I don't understand all the terminology used in the tagged templates section making it difficult to follow.

**CSS Tricks
This starts by explaining how template literals can be used for expressions and multiline strings again. It's useful for taking an object and displaying an html element. There are no () when we call a template literal. Still not super clear about tagged templates. 

**MDN forEach
Executes code once on each item in an array. It uses a callback function and works in an ascending order. The only way to break a forEach loop is to throw an exception. A for loop would be better suited if you require selective behavior. 

**for vs forEach
for loops are one of the most common ways that coders loop through arrays. I learned that you can nest another for loop inside. forEach accepts three arguements, the element value, the element index, and the array to traverse(not normally needed as it is referenced at the beginning of the loop a la array.forEach). for loops can work on non arrays, which might come up, but in professional development forEach is generally more useful.
