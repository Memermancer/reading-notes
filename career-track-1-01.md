***Promise
The promise object represents the completion or failure of an async operation, as well as its resultant value. It is a proxy for an as yet unknown value. Promises can be pending, fulfilled, or rejected. Promise.then() and Promise.catch() are methods that return promises, and can be chained.

***Destructuring
Unpacks values or properties from their container arrays/objects into distinct variables. 

***Spread
Spread syntax is an elipses( '...' ) and it expands an iterable (like an array or string) in places where arguments, elements, or key-value pairs are expected.

***Rest
The rest parameter can be used to represent an indefinite number of arguements as an array. It has to be the last parameter, usually preceded by a '...'.

***TDD, Where Did It All Go Wrong?
-Junior developers need TDD, but experienced devs don't?
-We write more test code than production code
-TDD can slow you down (Programmer Anarachy, Spike and Stabilize)
-Sometimes when we return to tests it is difficult to understand their intent
-Customers don't engage with testing suites, and they are slow and have an associated cost
-With tests that spend a great deal of time red, devs may start ignoring them
-Low reward high effort
-Devs want to build software
-TDD by Kent Beck, excellent text
-Test behaviors not implementation details
-Trigger for test is implementing a requirement
-Test the public API
-Write tests to cover the use cases or stories
-Refactoring is the key step for distinguishing between things that need to be tested and things that don'test
-Testing methods is difficult to maintain
-Make it run! Make things green!
-Be sinful! :)
-Refactoring is when we produce clean code, avoid duplication, sanitize the smell, identify patterns
-DO NOT WRITE NEW TESTS WHEN REFACTORING(safe moves, do not change behavior)

***What The Heck Is The Event Loop Anyway?
-How does JS actually work?
-Heap: memory allocation
-Stack: execution contexts
-Event Loop: Web APIs -> callback queue -> event loop -> stack
-Call Stack = one thread, one call stack, one thing at a time
-Blocking: what happens when things run slow
-Problems stem from running code in browsers
-We use async functions to get around browser performance issues
-Async allows concurrent operations
