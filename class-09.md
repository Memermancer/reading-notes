Html Chapter 7

Forms are a set of elements you can use in html to collect data from users. Lots of cool form controls exist, like submit, file upload, text, and toggling radio buttons. The form element contains these controls. Types like image and hidden can add extra features or style to a site. 

Html Chapter 14

Lists, tables, and forms are important elements on a page, and should be styling as such. I didn't know that you can use images as your bullet points. Tables have a lot of the standard properties of boxes, plus spefic styles for the different subelements such as table rows.

JS Chapter 6

Events are super important! They are the actions we take on a page. Code that responds to users relies on events to work. We've been using a lot of event listeners for clicking but there are many more, such as hover or submit. Events 'fire' or are 'raised' when they occur. The basic format is that you select an element, choose the event, then add the code you want to fire when the event happens. Eventlisteners are the best way to bind an event to an element, though it might not work on older verions of IE.
Flow is important to consider as events will cascade in a predictable fashion, if the events aren't in the right realtion to each other your app may not function. Today we worked with a submit listener and had to remove default behavior to get our code to function correctly. 
There are many kinds of events, mostly being divided into mouse, keyboard, form, mutation and ui events.
