Intro gets me pretty excited for this stuff! The styling looks great. Curious as to why he set a margin 0 on the body.

Radio Buttons: Take away the basic radio buttons by setting their opacity to zero. Then grab the custom checkbox image, then use the background position property to get the right part of the image to display. Then he uses the checked pseudo class for some black magic to change the background position to the checked value.

Checkboxes: Customizing the checkboxes was a similar process. Set the checkbox opacity, width, and margin all to 0. Add in the background image and set its position to display the proper thing. Then find the checked state using the checked psuedo class.

Text Inputs: The fieldset html tag is brand new to me! It looks pretty nice here. Goes with the legend tag. Simple changes make the inputs much nicer! Uses a similar picture trick as before, but instead of checked he is going to use a validation step.

Select Boxes: Used the appearance property and several vendor prefixes to clear the select styling. Used a similar technique to add a custom arrow image. The button was pretty simple, though I could stand to work with more shadows.

Validation Styles: He used required in the html which allows us to use the valid pseudo class. This is enough to give us our styles that change when the input is valid. The adjacent tick section is cool but a little opaque to me.
