***HTTP basics
Good 'ol Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It has no state, exists on the application,ayer and acts as a protocol to communicate through distributed systems. Usually TCP/IP port 80 but other systems or ports can be used. Uses CRUD-style requests. We've been interacting with it using Express quite a bit.

***How DNS Works
IP addresses are how computers communicate with one another, but humans remember words. The domain name systems allows the two values to stay synced. The browser and OS each search their cache first to see if the address is in memory. If not the resolver takes over. The resolver (usually your isp) can access the top-level domain for .com and can read the root. ICANN owns most of the TLDs.

***HTTP and rest
Solid review of basic API, REST, and HTTP. Mostly stuff we've done before but put together in a nice, concise manner.

***HTTP reference
Sweet reference for all the headers, status codes, and methods; bookmarked!

***rest reference
Similar but much smaller, this is a solid reference for the CRUD HTTP methods that are useful for RESTful services.
