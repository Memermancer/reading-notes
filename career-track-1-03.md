***Inside a Computer
I build my own PCs so this was pretty much review for me.

***Postgres Insert
Insert is the command to add a row into a table. We've used this before, but the optional Returning clause sounds interesting. 

***Postgres Select
Select is the main way to retrieve data from a database. We have used this before as well. The amount of options to determine what you want to select is thorough. It is also the operator that is used to join tables together.

***Postgres Update
Update modifies data in a table. Obviously a very important statement.

***Postgres Delete
Sometimes data goes bad, and delete is there to save the day.
