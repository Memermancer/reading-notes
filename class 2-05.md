**Heroku: Getting Started with Node
This wasn't too difficult at all, followed the intructions and got the sample web page deployed with no issues.

**Deploying a Simple Blog to Heroku
I learned that servers can begin life as js files. Node behaves in an asynchronous way to increase speed. Heroku can take that server and make it available worldwide. Not entirely clear what the node variables are doing. Sounds interesting and less archaic than I was expecting though.

**Improve Critical Thinking
Many problems that organizations encounter stem from a lack of critical thinking and a lack of metacognition. There are many logical traps that leadership can fall into. The three techniques to improve critical thinking that the author presents are: question assumptions, reason through logic, and diversify thought.
Questioning assumptions can unlock unseen oppurtunities. Reasoning through logic means closely following your chain of thought, making sure they connect in a sound and wholesome way at each step. Diversity feeds into both of the previous techniques. By having more perspectives on an issue an organization is less likely to encounter blind spots in their reasoning.

**Asking Great Questions
Some careers emphasize asking questions but this isn't the case for executives. Which is ironic as it is a position that can greatly benefit from asking the right questions. People enjoy talking about themselves, and generally enjoy answering questions. Asking questions fulfills the two primary reasons that people engage in conversation: exchanging information and managing impressions. Some tactics for asking good questions are to engage in follow up questioning, knowing when to keep a question open-ended (to alleviate the pressure to answer), sequence your questions to maximize their impact, using the right tone for the situation, and stay cognizant of group dynamics.
