**Applying Atomic Design
I don't have familiarity with Atomic design terms, guess I need to read that first. This seems like another form of the design trees that we've seen recently. Atoms are the pieces of a page that cannot be broken down further. Interesting file structure, based on the size of the component rather than something semantic.

**Thinking in React
Step 1 only. Start with a mock, I assume they mean some hard coded stuff. Then break everything into a hierarchy, using the single responsibility principle. This reminds me of wireframing.

**UI Components by Design
The introduction to this article was hard to understand, a lot of design jargon that I haven't experienced yet. But the core of the article makes sense. Modularize your design. Have designers and developers use the same vocabulary. Instead of using mock ups the primary way to communicate ui features was through finished, modular components.

**What are JS Callbacks?
A callback is a function that is to be executed after another function has finished. A function can take a function as an arguement and use that function. These are higher order functions. Callbacks help us ensure that functions are executed in the correct order. 

**JS Callback Functions
Very similar, a lot of the same information here.

**JS Classes
Lot of review here about objects, methods and this.
