Html Chapter 3
Lists! Definition lists I haven't used yet. They seem interesting and potentially useful for my styling.

Css Chapter 13
Css treats each html element as a box. We can manipulate these boxes. Overflow looks fun to play with. I haven't practiced with scrolling. Margins and paddings control the spacing between boxes. Visibility of boxes with the hidden property has already been very useful. Border radius looks tasteful as well.

JS Chapter 4
Starts with switch statements, which seems like an interesting way to display different elements. Js can every value as true or false. 
Logical operators go left to right.
Loops continue to perform a function until the condition is returned false. Can use a loop counter to set or increment the number of loops.
I don't fully understand the difference between for and while loops.
