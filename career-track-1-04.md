***PostgreSQL Joins
Good overview of the join keyword for postgres. I believe we've only used this once before so this is welcome. The Venn diagrams are a great visualization.

***One-to-one (data model)
This seems like the most straightforward model for joining tables.

***One-to-many (data model)
This is a one sided version, where the one can have relation to many. This is a very common parent-child relationship.

***Many-to-many (data model)
This is potentially the most complex model. A mix of projects and authors. HasAndBelongsToMany is an interesting way to phrase the relationship.
